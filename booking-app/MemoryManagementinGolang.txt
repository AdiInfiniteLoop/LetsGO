Go automatically manages memory 
Two keywords:
    1.new()
    2.make()
new()
memory allocated but not initialized
you will get a memory address
zeroed storage (cannot put any data initially)

make()
memory allocated and initialized
you will get a memory address
non-zeroed storage 


Garbage collection automatically happens

GOGC=100(default) sets the initial garbage collection target percentage
